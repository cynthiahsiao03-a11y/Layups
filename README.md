<h1>SUBC - Fiberglass Layups (Hull Fabrication) </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
As part of the submarine hull manufacturing process, I performed fiberglass layups to create a lightweight yet structurally durable composite shell. This involved cutting and positioning fiberglass sheets with proper fiber orientation, and applying resin to ensure full saturation and bonding between layers.

I assisted with layering multiple plies to achieve the required thickness and stiffness while minimizing air bubbles and defects. The process required attention to detail, material handling precision, and an understanding of how layering sequence affects structural performance. After layup, I supported curing and finishing processes to ensure surface quality and dimensional accuracy.

Through this experience, I gained hands-on knowledge of composite manufacturing, material behavior, and the importance of precision in structural fabrication.
